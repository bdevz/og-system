# Vendor History

Tracks which vendors have been used for which clients, response rates, and outcomes. Fed by submission outcomes. Used by Jay for vendor tier validation and by Z for conflict detection.

## Vendor performance (updated from submission outcomes)

| Vendor | Tier | Submissions | Responses | Interviews | Placements | Ghost Rate | Last Activity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | | |

## Vendor-client associations

Tracks known vendor-client relationships (which vendors recruit for which end clients). Built from submission data and Jay's research.

| Vendor | Known End Clients | Source |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

## Notes
- Ghost rate = submissions with no response after 14 days.
- Vendor tier is initially set by Jay's research, refined by actual outcomes.
- This data feeds into weekly retrospectives for vendor tier recalibration.
