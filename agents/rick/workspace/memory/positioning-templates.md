## Positioning Rules

1. **Start with candidate's strongest area.** If 10+ years Java, start with Java templates.
2. **Match to job title.** If job is "Microservices Architect", use microservices angle.
3. **Match to industry.** Different industries value different angles (finance ≠ startup).
4. **Skill coverage.** Candidate must have 80%+ of angle's emphasize skills.
5. **Experience range.** Adjust for seniority (Entry ≠ Senior ≠ Staff).
6. **Never fabricate.** If candidate lacks a skill, acknowledge it as growth area, not claim it.
7. **Update templates based on conversion feedback.** Track which angles convert best per industry/role.
