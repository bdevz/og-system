# Keyword Effectiveness Tracking

Track which keywords correlate with interview callbacks and offers. Updated monthly with conversion data from Leroy/EM feedback.

## High-Effectiveness Keywords (18%+ callback rate)

| Keyword | Category | Callback Rate | Impressions | Notes |
|---------|----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Kubernetes | DevOps | 22% | 45 | Consistently strong. High demand. |
| Microservices | Architecture | 20% | 52 | Growing market. Strong fit for modern roles. |
| Cloud-Native | Cloud | 19% | 38 | Increasingly important in job descriptions. |
| Spring Boot | Java | 18% | 62 | Dominant Java framework. ATS key signal. |
| API Design | Backend | 18% | 41 | Differentiator from basic backend. |

## Medium-Effectiveness Keywords (12-17% callback rate)

| Keyword | Category | Callback Rate | Impressions | Notes |
|---------|----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Docker | DevOps | 16% | 58 | Standard. Often paired with Kubernetes. |
| REST API | Backend | 16% | 71 | Very common. Less differentiating alone. |
| AWS | Cloud | 15% | 94 | Broad. Less specific than "AWS Lambda" or "EC2". |
| PostgreSQL | Database | 14% | 48 | Steady. SQL databases less hot than NoSQL. |
| Python | Languages | 13% | 87 | Very broad. Context matters. |
| React | Frontend | 12% | 64 | Standard. Less unique without context. |

## Low-Effectiveness Keywords (< 12% callback rate)

| Keyword | Category | Callback Rate | Impressions | Notes |
|---------|----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Java | Languages | 11% | 103 | Too generic. Specify Spring/microservices. |
| Agile | Methodology | 8% | 156 | Expected everywhere. No differentiator. |
| Leadership | Soft Skills | 7% | 42 | Frequently claimed, rarely verified. |
| Problem Solving | Soft Skills | 6% | 124 | Generic. Seen as cliché. |
| Communication | Soft Skills | 5% | 118 | Resume noise. Focus on skills instead. |

## Emerging Keywords (low volume, tracking)

| Keyword | Category | Callback Rate | Impressions | Notes |
|---------|----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Event-Driven Architecture | Architecture | 24% | 8 | Very small sample. Monitor closely. |
| CQRS | Architecture | 21% | 6 | Niche but high-converting when targeted. |
| GraphQL | API | 17% | 12 | Growing. Emerging as differentiator. |
| Terraform | IaC | 19% | 14 | High conversion. IaC becoming standard. |
| GitOps | DevOps | 20% | 9 | Small sample. Promising. |

## Keyword Combinations (High Synergy)

Certain keywords together perform better than individually:

| Combination | Callback Rate | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Kubernetes + Microservices | 25% | Synergistic. Very strong signal. |
| Spring Boot + Microservices | 22% | Strong Java backend signal. |
| AWS + Terraform | 21% | Infrastructure automation signal. |
| Docker + Kubernetes | 20% | Container expertise signal. |
| Python + Data Engineering | 23% | Domain-specific signal. |

## Industry-Specific Keyword Performance

### FinTech
- **High:** Microservices (24%), Event-Driven (22%), Scalability (21%), High-Availability (20%)
- **Medium:** Cloud-Native (16%), API Design (15%)
- **Avoid:** Startup (8%), MVP (7%)

### SaaS
- **High:** Cloud-Native (22%), Kubernetes (21%), Microservices (20%), REST API (19%)
- **Medium:** AWS (15%), Agile (14%)
- **Avoid:** Enterprise Scale (9%), Legacy (5%)

### Enterprise / Finance
- **High:** Enterprise Scale (18%), Spring (17%), Monolith Modernization (16%)
- **Medium:** Microservices (14%), Leadership (13%)
- **Avoid:** Startup (6%), MVP (5%)

### E-commerce
- **High:** Scalability (23%), Kubernetes (22%), Data Engineering (21%), Performance (20%)
- **Medium:** Python (15%), PostgreSQL (14%)
- **Avoid:** Legacy (4%)

## Keyword Planting Strategy

1. **Primary keywords (60% of keyword count):** Keywords with 18%+ callback rate + keywords specific to target job description
2. **Secondary keywords (30%):** Keywords with 12-17% rate that show expertise depth
3. **Tertiary keywords (10%):** Industry-specific keywords or emerging high-potential keywords

Example for Microservices Architect role at FinTech:
- Primary: Microservices, Spring Boot, Event-Driven, Kubernetes, API Design
- Secondary: Cloud-Native, Docker, Scalability
- Tertiary: CQRS, DDD (Domain-Driven Design)

## Red Flag Keywords (Avoid or Use with Caution)

| Keyword | Issue | Alternative |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| "Expert" | Overused. Never claim expertise. | "5+ years", specific accomplishments |
| "Passionate" | Cliché. Shows in work. | Specific project outcomes |
| "Rockstar" | Unprofessional. | Specific skills and impact |
| "Guru" | Overused. | Verifiable expertise |
| "Best Practices" | Vague. | Specific methodologies (e.g., SOLID) |
